Provides students with the fundamentals of game design and theory. Students learn to create and import assets, develop objectives, script behaviors and action, and build game levels. Students complete the course with an original portfolio-ready game.

Class time is spent learning game design and development fundamentals through instructional sessions, learning about different aspects of the game industry from guest speakers, in discussion and critique of 3D games, and in open-lab production.

##Learning Objectives:

* To develop students’ skills in 3D computer game design and development.
* To develop students’ understanding of 3D game project management and workflow.
* To introduce students to object oriented programming.
* To assist students in further developing analytical thinking and systems thinking.
* To introduce students to both commercial and indie areas of the game industry.

##Requirements:

* Attend every class.
* Attend and present on one outside of class activity that is related to game design / development.
* Complete required software training.
* Complete required reading.
* Complete and present two projects.
* Complete and present a research assignment.
* Design, develop, and present the final project.


##Software Training:

Students are required to complete the following software training. If a student has completed the training in the past or finds that the training is below their skill level, new appropriate training will be assigned.

Grading criteria for will be described below with each assignment.

##Assignments:

###Project 1:  

Create a 3D environment in Unity that can be navigated by the first person controller. Your understanding of the lessons and software training must be present in your work.

Wherever possible use your own work for all game assets. Work that diverges most from the tutorials and support files will receive the highest grades.

The finished project needs to be output as a standalone application for MAC, zipped, and then uploaded to your GitHub page before the start of class on the due date.

Projects that are not in the above format or that are turned in late will receive a lower grade.

Grading criteria for Project 1 is based on the following:

* Technical: Does the work show a technical understanding of the tutorials and lessons?
* Creative: Does the work diverge from the tutorials and lessons?
* Aesthetic: Do the aesthetics of the work evoke an intellectual or emotional response?

###Project 2: 

This is a group project. Based on the readings and guest speakers groups must make either a paper-prototype or a game design document.

Paper-prototype – Groups must propose a 3D digital game. Based on this game groups must create a playable paper-prototype and written documentation of the iterative design process. The paper-prototype and written documentation will be presented in class.

Game Design Document – Groups must propose a 3D digital game. Based on this game groups must create written design documentation. Templates for documentation will be provided. A power point based on the final design documentation will be presented in class.

Grading criteria for Project 2 is based on the following:
	
* The written documentation must clearly elucidate the proposed game or the iterative design process of the prototype. Points will be deducted for grammar and spelling errors.
* The quality of the presentation of the paper-prototype or design documentation. 

###Research Assignment / Presentation: 

Pick one aspect of your final project that relates to game development. Research best practice for this and present it to the class. Resources should be development forums such as the Unity forum or Stack Overflow.

This is not a traditional research paper. You only need to present best practice for the development of your research topic and cite why this best practice. If you cannot determine best practice then argue for the method that you will use.

The research assignment needs to be written in markdown language and uploaded to GitHub.

###Participation and Attendance: 

Two or more unexcused absences will result in the deduction of 10% of the overall grade for the course. Five or more unexcused absences will result in a failing grade.

Students are expected to participate during in-class discussion and critique. 

###Event Presentation: 

Attend a game related event and write a short synopsis in markdown language of your experience. Upload this synopsis to your GitHub and present it to the class.

###Final Project: 

This can be a group or individual project. Propose, design, and develop a portfolio ready 3D digital game.  

Individual - Grading will be based on your completed project. You will be evaluated on originality, creativity, and technical expertise.

Group- Grading will be based on both the completed project and on each group member’s contributions to the project. Each group member’s contributions will be tracked through GitHub. A lack of participation from a group member will result in a lower grade for that group member. The completed project will be evaluated on originality, creativity, and technical expertise.

The finished project needs to be output as a standalone application for MAC, zipped, and then uploaded to your GitHub page before the start of class on the due date.

Projects that are not in the above format or that are turned in late will receive a lower grade.

##Disability Statement 

Emerson College is committed to providing equal access to its academic programs and social activities for all qualified students with disabilities. While upholding this commitment, we require all Emerson students to meet the high standards of achievement that are essential to the College’s programs and services. To advance these dual aims, the College will provide reasonable accommodations to disabled students who request accommodations through the College’s Disability Services Office (DSO), if the DSO determines that accommodations are both medically necessary and reasonable. Please note that a requested accommodation will only be approved as ‘reasonable’ if it does not compromise any essential requirements of a course. Students who wish to request a disability accommodation must submit their request to the DSO, and not to faculty, since only the DSO is authorized to approve or deny any requests for accommodations. 
College employees and student’s family members cannot request accommodations on a student’s behalf. Rather, students who wish to request accommodations must themselves contact the DSO since Emerson’s philosophy is that its students are independent and self determined and students with disabilities—like non-disabled students—have control over their lives here at Emerson and are ultimately responsible for making their own decisions. Students who know at the start of a semester that they will need accommodations must submit their accommodation requests to the DSO within the first two weeks of the semester. If a student becomes ill or disabled during the course of a semester, or discovers after the start of a semester that he or she needs a disability accommodation, he or she is encouraged to submit his or her request to the DSO as soon as possible since the process of approving accommodations takes time, and approved accommodations will not be granted retroactively. The Director for Disability Services can be reached at: 617-824- 8592, dso@emerson.edu, 5th Floor 216 Tremont Street. 

##Plagiarism Statement 

It is the responsibility of all Emerson students to know and adhere to the College's policy on plagiarism, which can be found at: http://www.emerson.edu/policy/plagiarism. If you have any questions concerning the Emerson plagiarism policy or about documentation of sources in work you produce in this course, speak to your instructor. 

##Diversity Statement 

Every student in this class will be honored and respected as an individual with distinct experiences, talents, and backgrounds. Students will be treated fairly regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identification, disability, socio-economic status, or national identity. Issues of diversity may be a part of class discussion, assigned material, and projects. The instructor will make every effort to ensure that an inclusive environment exists for all students. If you have any concerns or suggestions for improving the classroom climate, please do not hesitate to speak with the course instructor or to contact the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at 617-824-8528 or by email at diversity_inclusion@emerson.edu
